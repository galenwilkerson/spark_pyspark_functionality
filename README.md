# Machine Learning and Data Manipulation with PySpark

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of Apache Spark and PySpark for data manipulation and machine learning, specifically using the Titanic dataset. Apache Spark is a powerful, distributed data processing engine that is well-suited for big data tasks, and PySpark is its Python API.

## Repository Contents

- `Machine Learning and Data Manipulation with PySpark.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that showcases how to use PySpark for data preprocessing, machine learning (using the Multilayer Perceptron Classifier), and model evaluation.

## Advantages of Spark and PySpark

Apache Spark offers several key advantages:

### Scalability
- **Distributed Computing**: Spark can process huge volumes of data by distributing the work across multiple computers.
- **In-Memory Computing**: Spark's in-memory processing capabilities allow it to perform big data analytics faster than other big data platforms that rely on disk storage.

### Ease of Use
- **High-Level APIs**: Spark provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python (PySpark), and R. PySpark, in particular, allows data scientists to leverage Spark's capabilities using Python, one of the most popular languages in data science.
- **Integrated Ecosystem**: Spark comes with built-in modules for SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing, making it a versatile tool for handling a wide array of data processing tasks.

### Performance
- **Optimized Execution Engine**: Spark's advanced DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution engine supports cyclic data flow and in-memory computing, leading to faster execution for complex workflows.

### Compatibility
- **Hadoop Integration**: Spark can be easily integrated with Hadoop and can read from and write to Hadoop data formats, making it a robust solution for big data processing in ecosystems that rely on Hadoop.

## Overview of the Titanic Dataset Notebook

The notebook included in this repository performs the following tasks on the Titanic dataset:

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
- The Titanic dataset is loaded into a Spark DataFrame.
- Preprocessing steps include converting categorical variables into numerical indices, handling missing values, and assembling all relevant features into a single feature vector.

### Machine Learning
- A Multilayer Perceptron Classifier is used to model the probability of survival of passengers on the Titanic, based on features like passenger class, sex, age, and fare.
- The model is trained on a split of the data, and its performance is evaluated on both the training set and a validation set to understand its generalization capability.

### Model Evaluation
- The accuracy of the model is computed on both the training and test datasets to assess overfitting or underfitting.
- The evaluations provide insights into the model's effectiveness at predicting survival, based on the learned patterns from the training data.

### Insights and Discussion
- The results and model performance metrics are discussed to provide insights into the potential uses of machine learning in historical data analysis.
